# Project Road Map:

As we were asked to do, I found a code from a previous group of students in the ksu-is group to use as my example repository. The code itself is well made and the comments made the sample really easy to follow. I inserted the code itself into jupyter notebooks and it ran on the first try. I'm really looking forward to using this code to my advantage to perfect my Stress-Off program!

# Sprint 1

- [X] Each person should have established a Github account and connected to our class organization (KSU-IS) in Github.
- [X] Each person should also be associated with ownership of a code repository in our Github organization.
- [X] Each person should have edited and committed changes in a readme.md file in a repository in our Github organization.
- [X] Each person should have explored at least one existing Python code based related to their project to evaluate using it in their project.
- [X] In evaluating your codebase, you should have read the code and attempted to run it yourself.
